# My Portfolio

Hi there, welcome to my portfolio. After a few month of learning React and TailwinCSS, Finally I can come up with some ideas to build my own profile website! :>

## TODO

### Home page

- [ ] scrolldown arrow icon

### Navbar

- [ ] add note pages
- [ ] add resume page
- [ ] add sidebar for some pages ?!

### React Project page

- [ ] include real data
- [ ] scrollup arrow icon
- [ ] new page for each projects (including what I learn - notes)

### Mini Project page

- [ ] include tailwindcss mini projects
- [ ] include more ongoing mini ones

### JS Game page

- [ ] include more

Nodejs API page

- coming soon

## Issues

- [ ] delay of fetching images on React Project page

## Improvment

### State and Props management

- [ ] will apply useContext hook for props
- [ ] will apply useReucer hook for states

### Layout

- [ ] unify the font-size, such as h1, h2, h3 etc. and others
- [ ] UI/UX research :>

### Design Pattern

- [ ] presentational / container pattern for component
- presentational component, that cares about how data is shown to the user.
- container component, that cares about what data is shown to the user
